This tutorial goes over [basic joystick controls](#joystick) and [basic pid loops](#pid).  
Make sure you completed the spin motor tutorial before going here.  
First go back to the Motor Subsystem, we go over
- Encoders
- Smart dashboard output

### Joystick
For the joystick controls, first go to SpinMotorJoystickCmd, it will cover
- Using suppliers
- Wrapper classes
- Using a deadband  

Then go to robotContainer, it goes over

### PID
For the PID loop control, go to SpinMotorPIDCmd, it goes over
- The basic concepts behind PID, this includes
  - error
  - setpoint
  - p term
  - i term
